Biggest Compressed Size value that the Block encoder supports. 

The maximum size of a single Block is limited by the maximum size of a Stream, which in theory is 2$^\wedge$63 -\/ 3 bytes (i.\-e. L\-Z\-M\-A\-\_\-\-V\-L\-I\-\_\-\-M\-A\-X -\/ 3). While the size is really big and no one should hit it in practice, we take it into account in some places anyway to catch some errors e.\-g. if application passes insanely big value to some function.

We could take into account the headers etc. to determine the exact maximum size of the Compressed Data field, but the complexity would give us nothing useful. Instead, limit the size of Compressed Data so that even with biggest possible Block Header and Check fields the total encoded size of the Block stays as a valid V\-L\-I. This doesn't guarantee that the size of the Stream doesn't grow too big, but that problem is taken care outside the Block handling code.

$\sim$\-L\-Z\-M\-A\-\_\-\-V\-L\-I\-\_\-\-C(3) is to guarantee that if we need padding at the end of the Compressed Data field, it will still stay in the proper limit.

This constant is in this file because it is needed in both \doxyref{block\-\_\-encoder.\-c}{p.}{block__encoder_8c} and \doxyref{block\-\_\-buffer\-\_\-encoder.\-c}{p.}{block__buffer__encoder_8c}.
